### Idea #1: Large-scale testing

Continue to grow our large-scale simulation framework in built around Mesos.  As you perform continued evaluations, identify areas where performance bottlenecks exist in the Erlang implementation and resolve these issues.

Expected results: 
* General improvements to Lasp

Knowledge prerequisites: 
* Erlang
* CRDTs
* Mesos
