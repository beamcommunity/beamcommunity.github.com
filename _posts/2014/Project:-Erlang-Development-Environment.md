### Project: Installers for Erlang development environment

Brief explanation: Setting up a development environment for Erlang requires installing Erlang Run-Time System and configuring editor of your choice. This project aims at enabling people to compile and run their first program within 30 minutes.

Expected results: A first stab at this could be to create a browser based IDE (or use existing editor, which supports Erlang mode) and have installers for Erlang for each platform underneath. Then a number of extra things can be added on top of this base problem, e.g. small examples and tutorials.

Knowledge prerequisites: An understanding of Erlang installation and compilation process on platforms like RaspberryPi, Mac OS X, Windows.
